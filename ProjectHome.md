Music Player Minion is a client for the Music Player Daemon network music player.  The purpose of MPD and it's clients is to allow music playback on one PC (such as a home media server) to be controlled from another over the network.

This particular client is written in XUL, the toolkit that is used for Mozilla applications such as Firefox, and packaged as a Firefox extension.  Unlike other browser based clients, no web server is required.  Music Player Minion takes advantage of the advanced capabilities of XUL to communicate directly with MPD over TCP sockets.

Thanks to everyone that helped out by adding a review on addons.mozilla.org, this extension is now available there.  Although new versions may be available here first, versions posted there will receive automatic updates.
